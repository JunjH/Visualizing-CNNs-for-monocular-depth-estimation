Introduction
-
We attempt to interpret CNNs for monocular depth estimation. To this end, we propose to locate the most relevant pixels of input image to depth inference. We formulate it as an optimization problem of identifying the smallest number of image pixels from which the CNN can estimate a depth map with the minimum difference from the estimate from the entire image.

Extensive experimental results show

+ The behaviour of CNNs that they seem to select edges in input images depending not on their strengths but on importance for inference of scene geometry.

+ The tendency of attending not only on the boundary but the inside region of each individual object.

+ The importance of image regions around the vanishing points for depth estimation on outdoor scenes.
